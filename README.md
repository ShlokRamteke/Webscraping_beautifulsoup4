# Webscraping_beautifulsoup4

I have used beautifulsoup4 to extract data from the following publications:
1) UX Collective
2) Data Driven Investor
3) Better Humans
4) Better Marketing
5) The Startup

Now,  I have extracted the following for each article:

* URL of the article
* title
* subtitle
* image
* number of claps
* number of responses
* reading time
* publication
* date of publishing

50 days are selected randomly from the the year 2020

Everythig is stored in data list. it is then converted to medium_df Dataframe.
Latly everything is converted to csv file
